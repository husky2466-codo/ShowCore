## Prompt

I want you to implement ShowCore, a technician discovery marketplace for the AV industry. I'm providing you with:

1. **Product Overview** - Description, problems, solutions, and key features
2. **Implementation Instructions** - Detailed guides for each milestone
3. **Design Components** - Reference React components with Tailwind CSS
4. **Backend Stubs** - tRPC + Hono + Prisma scaffolding

Before you begin, please ask me the following clarifying questions:

### Authentication
- Which authentication provider should we use? (Clerk, Auth0, NextAuth, custom JWT, etc.)
- What social login options do you need? (Google, GitHub, etc.)

### User Modeling
- How should the User, Technician, and Company models relate?
- Can one user have multiple roles?

### Tech Stack

- What deployment target? (Vercel, Cloudflare, AWS, etc.)
- What database? (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)

### Integrations

- What file storage? (Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, Uploadthing, etc.)
- What real-time solution? (WebSockets, Pusher, Ably, etc.)

Once I answer these questions, implement the full application following the instructions I've provided. Use the design components as reference for UI patterns and styling.

The design system uses:
- **Primary**: Amber
- **Secondary**: Yellow
- **Neutral**: Zinc
- **Typography**: DM Sans, IBM Plex Mono

Please follow TDD practices - implement tests alongside features. Each section includes test specifications.
