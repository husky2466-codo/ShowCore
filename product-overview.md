# ShowCore

## Description
ShowCore is a technician discovery marketplace that connects AV (audio-visual) technicians with companies and clients. It brings transparency, fair compensation, and quality discovery to the live events industry through verified profiles, market analytics, and community-building tools.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Unfair Compensation
AV technicians often lack visibility into fair market rates, leading to inconsistent and sometimes below-market pay. ShowCore provides transparent job postings with suggested pay ranges and real-time market analytics, ensuring technicians can negotiate fair compensation.

### Problem 2: Difficult Promotion
Companies and manufacturers struggle to reach technicians and clients effectively. ShowCore offers product showcase pages and subscription tiers that help businesses promote their products and services directly to their target audience.

### Problem 3: Poor Discovery
Finding high-quality, reliable technicians is challenging for clients. ShowCore surfaces top talent through verified skill profiles, XP-based tier progression (Beginner to Pro), and transparent ranking algorithms.

### Problem 4: Trust Issues
Both technicians and clients face uncertainty when working with new partners. ShowCore builds trust through show proof verification (AI + admin review), bidirectional review systems, insurance verification, and formal dispute resolution.

### Problem 5: Industry Fragmentation
The AV industry lacks a centralized hub for networking and professional development. ShowCore connects the community through real-time messaging, booking management, mentorship matching, and lottery rewards for engaged members.
